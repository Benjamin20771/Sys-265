# LAB 01 - Setting up labs

## Summary
In this lab, at the beginning of the year, we always setup or lab environments, which is what I'm going to document right now. I know how to do almost everything now, so it's mostly going to be the specs. I will go over some steps in detail if needed. In this lab, we set up our FW, AD, WKS, and MGMT. MGMT is a new one for us, so I'll go over that one later, a little more in detail. The setup includes Networking and DNS, and basic account handling.
